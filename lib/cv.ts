  summary:
    "Software Engineer focused on solving customer problems. Six years at AMFG, from Junior to Team Lead, building the automation, scheduling, and integration surfaces behind a platform used by 100+ manufacturers and machine shops. I love helping people and work in teams when we can achieve big goals together. Really like Agentic Workflows with AI and building great architectures. When I was a teen, I thought that I would be a backend engineer because frontend is easy and not interesting, now I enjoy both, but frontend is ♥︎. I'm also active on tech side of Twitter if you like my tweets we can be friends 😅.",
  about:
    "I like to create beautiful UIs, like to dress well, and like NBA and football. I'm a big dog lover - have one myself, named Theo. I used to run and a lot, and had run a half-marathon back in the day. I love rap festivals, I was at Rolling Loud and others, saw Travis Scott, Playboi Carti and some more, planning on visiting more. Trying to be happy and make people around me happy too.",
